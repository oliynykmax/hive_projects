## General Guidelines

- To complete projects, students needs to pass code reviews by multiple peers. The evaluatee needs to be able to explain their code and its validity - since students have varying levels of perfectionism, we often defer to the restrictions imposed by assignment instructions (and the discuss any implicit leeways).
- For all projects using the C programming language, students are required to follow the "Norm" - a set of code style and linting rules. Some of these can be validated with the ["norminette"](https://github.com/42school/norminette) program and some are left for human review.  
  These rules include, but are not limited to:
  - No comments inside functions
  - No `for` loops, or `switch` statements, or ternary statements
  - Variable declarations at the beginning of functions, single declaration per line
  - No assignments in declarations (except for `const`/`static`/`global` variables)
  - Up to:
    - 80 characters per line
    - 25 lines per function
    - 4 function parameters
    - 5 variable declarations per function
    - 5 functions per file
